# Simple SmartHome App

This project is a simple SmartHome app developed as part of the iOS module at the Syntax Institute. It is the second app created in the course and focuses on concepts such as States and Bindings, `foreach` loops, the `Identifiable` protocol, and the `Picker` control in SwiftUI.

## About the App

The Simple SmartHome App simulates the control of devices in a smart home. Users can select different devices, toggle their state (on/off), and adjust the brightness of lamps. The app demonstrates how to manage states in SwiftUI, bind data to views, and iterate through collections using `foreach`.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Display a list of smart home devices.
- **State Control**: Turn devices on and off.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Adjust the brightness of lamps using a slider.
- **Device Selection**: Select devices using a picker.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **States and Bindings**: Managing and synchronizing the state of the user interface.
- **`foreach`**: Iterating over a list of devices to dynamically create the UI.
- **`Identifiable`**: Uniquely identifying devices in the list.
- **`Picker`**: Selecting devices from a list.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LarsNicodemus/Simple-SmartHome-App.git
Open the project in Xcode.

Run the app on a simulator or a physical device.
